Static websites are made using the languages of HTML and CSS. If you want to make your website do stuff instead of just sitting there and looking pretty (e.g. show some new text when the user clicks a button, like 'Submitted. Congratulations!'), you need a bit of another language called Javascript, which I will come to at the end of this session.

Download [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (it never requires you to pay for a license but you should buy one eventually if you keep using it!) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) beforehand.
