In particular, there was a girl who often complained that she was bored and didn't care, and I get the sense that the girls who sat around her lost a lot of interest in what we were doing because of her opposition.

So on one hand girls are already less likely to have an interest in CS when entering college, and then any classes they take seem to be dominated by males (both in numbers and in previous expertise).

There are a ton of factors that cause the gender gap.  This is a nationwide problem that stems from a variety of causes that start from an extremely young age.  Girls are generally discouraged from entering STEM fields and taught to believe that boys are better at STEM (both in overt and subtle ways).  It is hard to overcome the gap because girls are less likely to want to enter CS when they see how few women there are.  A lack of female role models and women in high power positions in tech companies, etc. is problematic as well.  Not only are not enough women getting into CS however, women also leave.  Perhaps due to the culture of CS and tech companies that is not always super welcoming to women.At Harvard specifically, the gender gap is particularly bad, perhaps due to the Harvard specific culture, although I'm not entirely sure.  It is good we have organizations like WiCS, but there is still a lot of work to be done.  We need to ensure that the CS department is welcoming to all genders and foster an inclusive community.","There is an obvious impact in the fact that, for example, my current CS class is at most 10% women.
